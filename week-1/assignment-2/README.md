# Remote assignment - week 1

It is a page layout in pure HTML/CSS.

Because I git the wrong file, and I cannot use submodules to deal this problem.

So the assignment-2 file didn't have any history.(´･_･`)

It's only have a final works.

But! There are some points:
1. Website Title / Logo in the navigator should align to the left.
2. Menu Items in the navigator should align to the right.
3. Total width of content boxes should be fixed in 1200px when screen width > 1200px.

If you have any suggestions, please contact me (,,・ω・,,) -> mongzhen0856@gmail.com
